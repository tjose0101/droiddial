Tone Dial has two modes, enabled or disabled.

==Enabled==

When Tone Dial is enabled you'll see the Tone Dial icon in the status bar and all contacts dialed will tone dial instead of using the mobile network.
To enable Tone Dial, start the Tone Dial application and check the Enable check box. We might change this so that it automatically enables when you start the application.

==Disabled==

When Tone Dial is disabled, your phone will dial normally on the mobile network.
To disable Tone Dial simply uncheck the Tone Dial checkbox in the prerences.
You can navigate to these preferences quickly from the Tone Dial icon in the notification bar.

==Notifications==

Tone Dial will display the last number dialed. This can help you if think you may have your country or trunk codes set incorrectly.
