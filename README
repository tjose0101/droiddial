A DTMF Tone Dial Androidâ„¢ Application

This is our first Android Application, it aims to provide a simple tool
that will allow you to dial a contact from your mobile using a landline.

Tone Dial is an exercise for us to learn about Android
It aims to exercise the following:
- Automated Testing
-- How easy is it to automate Unit and Functional tests

- Simple Activity
-- Persistent preferences

- BroadCastReceiver to catch Dial events from the contact list

- Icons
-- Can a non artist use GIMP to make icons

- Model View Presenter pattern
-- View events appear to be like MVP interactions sent from Views
-- Intents appear to be like MVP commands sent from the Presenter
